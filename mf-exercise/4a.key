## RENAMED FOR GIT COMMAND LINE EXERCISE

4. How many files and how many folders are there in the entire repo? Which commands did you run? (Report the count of files and folders separately)
- Windows Explorer: RH click on file properties of robot-shop directory : 212 Files, 65 Folders

- GitHubDesktop: (doesnt appear to be a way)

- GitClient: 
+ git ls-files ? Don't think this is the right approach (more research required)

= Using cmd dir: 
+ dir /b /s /ad "C:\Data\z.Work\GitClient\robot-shop" | find /c /v "" => Folders = 63
+ dir /b /s /a-d "C:\Data\z.Work\GitClient\robot-shop" | find /c /v "" => Files = 197

= Using cmd batch script:
+ set dirsCount=0 & (for /D /R %f in (*) do @(set /a dirsCount+=1 > nul)) & set dirscount = 62
+ set filesCount=0 & (for /R %f in (*) do @(set /a filesCount+=1 > nul)) & set filescount = 197

EXAMPLE OF ADDING lines from command line:
echo + dir ^/b ^/s ^/a-d "C:^\Data^\z.Work^\GitClient^\robot-shop" ^| find ^/c ^/v "" =^> Files = 197 >> 4.key
